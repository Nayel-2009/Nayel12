  <h2 style="color: #2a7f6f;">What Is Bullying?</h2>
  <p>
    Bullying is when someone repeatedly hurts, threatens, excludes, or mistreats another person on purpose. 
    It can happen with words, actions, or online. Bullying is not a one-time disagreement or argument — it's 
    behavior that happens more than once and creates an unfair power imbalance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Physical bullying:</strong> Harm through actions like hitting or pushing.</li>
    <li><strong>Verbal bullying:</strong> Hurtful comments, insults, or name-calling.</li>
    <li><strong>Social bullying:</strong> Leaving someone out, spreading rumors, or damaging friendships.</li>
    <li><strong>Cyberbullying:</strong> Using phones, social media, or online spaces to embarrass or harm someone.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: #2a7f6f;">How Bullying Affects People</h2>
  <p>
    Bullying can have a big impact on someone's emotional and social well-being. Even if the actions seem small 
    to others, the experience can stay in someone’s mind for a long time. Bullying can affect:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Many people start to feel unsure about themselves.</li>
    <li><strong>School life:</strong> It can make people feel distracted, stressed, or uncomfortable at school.</li>
    <li><strong>Friendships:</strong> Bullying can make it hard to trust others or feel included.</li>
    <li><strong>Emotions:</strong> People may feel sad, worried, or alone when they’re dealing with bullying.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="color: #2a7f6f;">Why Preventing Bullying Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Stopping bullying is important because everyone deserves to feel safe and respected. Learning how to support 
    others, speak up, and show kindness helps create a stronger, healthier community where people can grow and 
    feel valued.
